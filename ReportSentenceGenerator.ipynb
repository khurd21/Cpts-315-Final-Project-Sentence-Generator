    "to it. I was initially going to try and apply this concept onto an infitinite supply of Tweets from Twitter, but I was not given permission by Twitter to use their API. So I thought\n",

    "A <b>Markov Chain</b> is a model that makes predictions based on a sequence of potential states. It will weigh the probability in which a set of states will be in the sequence and use this information to generate a new sequence. The defining characteristic in which probability is weighed is exclusively dependent on a current state and a passage of time. In other words, past states do not influence the Markov Chain, only the current state. The transition from the current state to the next state in a <b>Markov Chain</b> is determined by using probabilty. The algorithm will consider the probability of a current state transitioning to a potential state and transition based on frequency. \n",

He was covered with a thick hedge on the inner side. Over this the Road crossed by a causeway; but where it pierced the hedge it was barred by a ridge of high land; its dark edge against the sky was again clear would Aragorn rise. Then he sprang up and went home. Peeta and I and the other fisting in my hair. Warmth radiates from the spot where his lips just touch my neck, slowly spreading through the bloodstream, so that, once bitten, our prey is in too much physical pain to be separated from him now. \"I can't be sure, I'm still woozy,\" I managed to respond.\n",

      "I shove his hands off my shoulders and I looked at his master; and at last he nodded and closed his eyes. He'd never been less human... or more beautiful. Face ashen, eyes wide, I sat like a bird to rest in the green muffler? \"Thank you. I'm glad to meet you, Ana,” Jack says softly as Taylor speeds into the night and couldn't sleep again for what seemed like a fun, teasing idea. Now, I’m almost outside with No Panties! He peers down at me and smiled; sunlight glinted off his face, his deter- mined stride toward me like I want and need him, and deep down I know that’s not an option. That the audience would recognize me when I say that if you think about our arrangement while you’re away?” he asks. “Yes.” “Will you miss me?” I gaze at his beautiful face. He’s giving nothing away, but he keeps his eyes on the rose, I say, “I vote yes . . . who worries about . . . no wonder it’s impossible not to mimic them. Venia makes what’s supposed to be on the watch. I name you Elf-friend; and may the others find a safe place to pat. She made do with my forehead; it was unbandaged. \"Bella, honey, you hate Forks,\" she reminded me. I have a date with Edward Cullen tonight, and he wanted me. \"You miss your mother,\" he said, grinning again. \"Don't leave me,\" I begged in a broken voice. This is where the stream becomes clear and smooth again, though it runs swiftly. The top splits and from below rises a second tabletop that holds our lunch.\n",

      "The dining room’s empty except for Peeta and me at the Capitol when we win,” I say. I turn and leave the reward to you. You may be weary before we halt.\" \"Why? I was happy about the sunlight. But that wasn't the best idea,\" he mused. They’re both to our left, with Castor toward the front and Pollux bringing up the rear so they’ll be sure not to record each other. He can’t stay away from you; I knew you had a mind. I just want to get you into the right frame of mind, to understand where I’m coming from.\n",

      "I look up from his eyes, a head lower than hers. Lee and Samantha, Lauren, glaring toward us, with Conner; I could name every face that spiraled past me. Then I see the president fixated on me as well? Peeta and I, on the other side. His breathing accelerates. He deepens the kiss, leaning into me. How can I tell him you said you were unwell last week.” “I’m fine, thank you, Mr. Grey.” The photographer scurries off. Even the sight of my fingernails, caked with blood, stops me. I’ve been unable to move my hands. A green shaft of light bursts out of the ashes of their fire the snow lay many feet deep, higher than the heads of the crowd. Pushing me higher, higher to the castle in the sky. You'll get lost. People don't go in for such things much now. And I am going to try and categorize and analyze my feelings for him. I’m not afraid, not even watchful. Which makes me an easy target. And he doesn't like to ask you questions about her because he will be filled with wrath. But Gondor stands, and even the end of class, and stretched my arms out behind me, I’m re- minded of the time I finished. He didn't look surprised that I'd told my father the truth. He might have arrived, while they were delayed in the Forest of Fangorn. Strong. Hard to admit, but he was something of a joke since the Capitol’s been using it to make an impression. No one’s thrilled with the same vigour and delight. He was smoking now in silence, for Frodo was sitting still, deep in thought. Maybe that was the frontier of war. In the next pie wedge over came the blood rain, where Johanna, Wiress, and Beetee were caught. The expressions range from pleasure to distress, from sorrow to satisfaction. Even the most Capitol-loving, Games-hungry, bloodthirsty person out there can’t ignore, at least for my taste, into a young woman with remarkable negotiating skills.\n",

      "I think of that question in the future, when the brothers and sisters had been raised up, escaped with him into the saltwater. We slather ourselves down, even taking turns rubbing the ointment into each other’s eyes. I looked down at my hands. That’s what I’m hindered by in this game of se- duction. Stocks, whipping posts, and this, the remains of a book. Then the ground began to fall from the mountain-side, whist- ling over their heads, or crashing on the path outside whistling. I could imagine how much more overwhelming his eyes would be. \"Do you need any help finding your next class?\" he asked. I cannot allow him to have this level of influence over me. When Frodo came at last up on to the dry ground on the far side of the tree. Or I don’t know. It still seems too small. I should try to think if this is news. \"I was wrong — you're much more observant than I gave you credit for.\" \"I thought you liked the Cullens.\" \"He's too old for you,\" he ranted. We are forbidden to engage in any combative exercise with another tribute. It’s enough to bring him to the mirror room, and the floor is old, old varnished wood.\n",

      "As the Piper picks up speed, so do we. It’s very bumpy, and in front of me. And then the bell rang at last. I hoped you would take to stop you, if you had a mind. I’m the mockingjay and it’s too hard keeping me alive as it is. Date: May 30 2011 22:22 To: Christian Grey Sir, you are quite the disciplinarian,” I hiss at Gale. Too long I have survived the worst, opening my eyes to gaze at him. He’s eyeing me speculatively. \"Some of the scouts have been sent out already. More will go tomorrow. Elrond is sending Elves, and they will not fail.\" \"No hope while the Ring lasts,\" said Frodo. \"Isn't there some trick? Wouldn't the beast bolt back to him with my hand, but I’m laughing. “Stop! Cato could be right outside our cave.” He grabs my hips and positions himself, and I brace myself for this meeting. They appear in the sky until it’s directly overhead. The metal talons slide under me. I want you to look straight ahead, as if the Gamemakers are intent on washing us all away. The thunder’s so powerful it seems to have been tramping on, on, endlessly to the mountains\" roots. This is it? I think grouchily. Shouldn’t my homecoming dinner be a little gold mine. You’re a little cooler though. Okay – I like this. And we move together. I tug his soft, sexy hair. He has commitment issues.” I nod, as if in a last-ditch effort, Peeta raises his eyebrows questioningly. Eighteen slaps in total. My body is responding... There are more in the drawers but I just brush them off. I hear the ping of incoming mail from the mean machine up again.\n",
