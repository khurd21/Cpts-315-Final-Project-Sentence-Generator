    "My motivation for designing a Sentence Generator was first inspired by a concept I read when reading about how the Google Definition `Word Usage Over Time` was implemented.\n",
    "Google provides a feature where when you look up the definition of a word, it provides a chart showing said word's usage over a period of time. I then read about how Google\n",
    "used a method called N-Grams to help determine this. This then led me to the concept where one would be able to predict the usage of a word based on the previous words leading up\n",
    "to it. I was initially going to try and apply this concept onto an infitinite supply of Tweets from Twitter, but I was not given permission by Twitter to use their API. So I thought\n",
    "of a different way to apply this N-Gram concept by reading a source text such as a book or article. From analyzing said article, I could generate new sentences that are similar\n",

    "A <b>Markov Chain</b> is a model that makes predictions based on a sequence of potential states. It will weigh the probability in which a set of states will be in the sequence and use this information to generate a new sequence. The defining characteristic in which probability is weighed is exclusively dependent on a current state and a passage of time. In other words, past states do not influence the Markov Chain, only the current state. The transition from the current state to the next state in a <b>Markov Chain</b> is determined by using probabilty. The algorithm will consider the probability of a current state transitioning to a potential state and transition based on frequency. \n",
